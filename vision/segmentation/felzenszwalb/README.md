Implementation of Efficient Graph-Based Image Segmentation by Pedro F. Felzenszwalb and Daniel P. Huttenlocher.

Image segmentation is the process of dividing image into `semantically` similar regions. It's a huge field in computer vision and there's a vast amount of literature on this topic. However, [this paper](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~dph/papers/seg-ijcv.pdf) is a nice starting point because it's simple and also it's fast. At the risk of trading some accuracy, it gives us decent results in less time. This is really good from an object detection point of view.
